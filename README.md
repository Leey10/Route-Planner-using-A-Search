# Route-Planner-using-Astar-Search
## Introduction
This is one of the cource projects for Udacity Intro to self-driving car nano-degree. The task is to implement A* search with Python.
## Files of the project
1. A python file: helpers.py is provided which contains a map with 40 nodes. The map is stored as a dictionary, where the keys are node number from 0 to 39, and the values giving information on the (x,y) coordinates of each node on map and the neighbors of each node. The helper function also provides useful methods to load and show the map.
2. Astar.ipynb is the working notebook to implement A* algorithm with Python.
